Trying Vibe style coding to try to make a simple alert workflow manager for air gapped systems
problem:

There are no visual alert managment systems that allow you to define a workflow and allow your support agents to work through the flow with assigning alerts, creating notes on the alert, make a ticket on the the alert and add all notes/annotations on the tickets. all this and be air gapped for secure systems... There are several very good ones that are Saas but are not usable for the highest security.
